## Abstract 
Human Resource Management system(HRMS) is a project developed for software companies to
help them in resource allocation and management. The main aim of the project is to manage
and update the employee details in the company along with computerization of recruitment
process. The implementation of project forms an effective managing platform in the software
companies.

Early systems were narrow in scope, typically focused on a single task, such as improving the
payroll process or tracking employees‚Äô work hours. Today‚Äôs systems cover the full spectrum of
tasks associated with human resources departments, including tracking and improving process
efficiency, managing organizational hierarchy, tracking absence and annual leave, simplifying
financial transactions, and providing reports on people data. In short, as the role of human
resources departments expanded in complexity, HR technology systems evolved to fit these
needs.

Human resources software is used by businesses to combine a number of necessary HR functions, 
such as storing employee data, managing payroll, recruitment, benefits administration,
time and attendance, employee performance management, and tracking competency and training records.

Human Resource Management System software acts as a bridge between HR department and
Development department in software companies. HRMS looks after overall technical and non
technical work details that are carried out in organizations.
